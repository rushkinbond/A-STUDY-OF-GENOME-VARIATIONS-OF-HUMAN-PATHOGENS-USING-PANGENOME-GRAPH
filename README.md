# A-STUDY-OF-GENOME-VARIATIONS-OF-HUMAN-PATHOGENS-USING-PANGENOME-GRAPH
## Introduction to the project
Our project aims to focus on exploring the pangenome concept, moving away from the reliance on a single reference genome to delve deeper into genetic variations. It involves the creation of pangenome graphs for specific COVID-19 variants (Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron) observed across multiple countries. Additionally, our project aims to construct a pangenome graph for a single country that includes the Alpha, Beta, and Omicron variants. The project also intends to identify and analyze structural changes between two GFA (Graphical Fragment Assembly) files.

#### Pangenome Concept Exploration:

Emphasis on the concept of pangenomes over the use of a single reference genome.
Highlighting the significance of pangenome graphs in capturing genetic variations among different variants of the COVID-19 virus.

#### Pangenome Graph Generation:

Creation of pangenome graphs for distinct COVID-19 variants (Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron) observed across various countries.
Development of a specific pangenome graph for a single country that encompasses the Alpha, Beta, and Omicron variants.

#### Analysis of Genetic Variations:

Examination of the structural changes between two GFA files to identify variations in the genetic composition of the different variants.
Identification and characterization of unique genetic features or alterations specific to each variant or country-specific pangenomes.

#### Methodology:

Detailing the methodologies used to construct pangenome graphs, analyze GFA files, and detect structural changes.
Description of the computational tools, algorithms, or bioinformatics techniques utilized for data processing, graph generation, and comparison.

#### Data Representation and Visualization:

Visualization of pangenome graphs using suitable software or tools to represent the genetic relationships and variations between different variants and countries.
Presentation of comparative analyses through visual aids, charts, or diagrams to illustrate the differences in genetic structures.
