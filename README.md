# A-STUDY-OF-GENOME-VARIATIONS-OF-HUMAN-PATHOGENS-USING-PANGENOME-GRAPH
### Introduction to the project
Our project aims to focus on exploring the pangenome concept, moving away from the reliance on a single reference genome to delve deeper into genetic variations. It involves the creation of pangenome graphs for specific COVID-19 variants (Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron) observed across multiple countries. Additionally, our project aims to construct a pangenome graph for a single country that includes the Alpha, Beta, and Omicron variants. The project also intends to identify and analyze structural changes between two GFA (Graphical Fragment Assembly) files.
